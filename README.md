This version is an official unstable branch of Omniverse Chess. 

1D Chess is just a single strip of the board that only includes the rook, horse (knight) and king.

right now for 1d chess there was going to be a stalemate but thats been a pain in the ass to make so nope!


2D chess is just normal chess :) some features are missing from normal chess like indication that your being checked.

3D Chess (Raumschach variant) is normal chess but the layout is confusing so here is the rundown of some features

Pieces can move up and down a board and the way they move up and down were determined by the rules of Raumschach. I recommend searching up the rules for it so you can get a general understanding of it. otherwise it will be even more confusing that it actually is.


4D Chess is just like 3D chess but instead of being able to move up and down a board, you can move forward and backward a board. these new boards will generally make it more confusing so just try to learn the game as you play it. its in 3D geometrically so you can somewhat understand it better.

This current version has a functioning 4D Chess being worked on right now.

when your entering this website please expect this website to be unstable and maybe even broken at some times. please inform me when these bugs occure via issuing the github (only beta testers have link to the github so if your not a beta test.... welcome)
